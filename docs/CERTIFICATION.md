# Conduit Component Certification

This document explains the comprehensive certification test suite that validates Conduit component compliance and ecosystem readiness.

## Overview

The Conduit Component Certification ensures that components meet the standards required for seamless integration with the Conduit ecosystem while embodying the liberation philosophy of developer empowerment.

## Running Certification

### Quick Certification
```bash
./component certify
```

### Detailed Output
```bash

- PHP syntax validation

**Success Criteria**: All code quality tools pass without errors or warnings.

### 5. Architecture Validation Tests (`ArchitectureValidationTest`)

**Purpose**: Validates proper Laravel Zero and Conduit architecture patterns.

**Tests Include**:
- Required directory structure exists
- Configuration files present
- BaseCommand architecture compliance
- CommandInterface contract implementation
- Service provider architecture
- Bootstrap architecture validation
- PSR-4 namespace structure
- Component binary architecture
- Config follows Laravel Zero patterns
- Command discovery patterns
- Dependency injection setup
- Error handling architecture

**Success Criteria**: Component follows established architectural patterns and conventions.

### 6. Component Standards Tests (`ComponentStandardsTest`)

**Purpose**: Ensures compliance with Conduit-specific configuration standards.

**Tests Include**:
- Commands.php configuration structure
- Default command configuration
- Command paths validation
- Published commands structure
- Hidden commands configuration
- App.php essential configuration
- Command registration patterns
- Laravel Zero conventions
- Dual-mode configuration support
- Environment configuration
- Service provider registration

**Success Criteria**: All configuration files follow Conduit ecosystem standards.

## Certification Levels

### ✅ PASS
Component meets all Conduit standards and is ready for ecosystem integration.

### ❌ FAIL
Component has issues that must be resolved before Conduit integration.

```

### Common Failure Patterns

#### Missing Interface Implementation
```
Commands should implement CommandInterface when extending BaseCommand
```
**Solution**: Ensure all commands extending `BaseCommand` implement the required interface methods.

#### Configuration Issues
```
Commands config should have 'published' key
```
**Solution**: Update `config/commands.php` to include all required configuration sections.

#### Code Quality Failures
```
Pint should report no style issues
```
**Solution**: Run `./vendor/bin/pint` to fix code style issues.

#### Architecture Violations
```
Required directory should exist: app/Contracts
```
**Solution**: Create missing directories and files according to the standard structure.

## Fixing Certification Issues

### 1. Review Failed Tests
Use `--detailed` flag to get complete error information:
```bash
./component certify --detailed
```

### 2. Run Specific Test Suite
Focus on one area at a time:
```bash
./component certify --suite=CodeQuality
```

### 3. Fix Common Issues

#### Add Missing Configuration
```php
// config/commands.php
return [
    'default' => NunoMaduro\LaravelConsoleSummary\SummaryCommand::class,
    'paths' => [app_path('Commands')],
    'add' => [],
    'hidden' => [/* hidden commands */],
    'published' => [/* publishable commands */],
    'remove' => [],
];
```

#### Implement Required Interface
```php
use App\Contracts\CommandInterface;

class YourCommand extends BaseCommand implements CommandInterface
{
    // Interface methods are inherited from BaseCommand
}
```

#### Fix Code Style
```bash
./vendor/bin/pint
```

### 4. Re-run Certification
```bash
./component certify
```

## Best Practices for Certification

### 1. Regular Testing
- Run certification tests before major releases
- Include certification in CI/CD pipelines
- Test after adding new commands or features

### 2. Documentation
- Keep command descriptions clear and helpful
- Ensure help text is comprehensive
- Document liberation metrics accurately

### 3. Quality Standards
- Follow PSR standards for code style
- Write meaningful tests for new functionality
- Keep dependencies up to date

### 4. Liberation Philosophy
- Design commands to save developer time
- Provide meaningful automation
- Capture useful knowledge metadata
- Consider publishability for valuable commands

## Integration with Conduit Ecosystem

Once certified, your component can:

1. **Be registered** with the Conduit component registry
2. **Publish commands** to the global Conduit namespace
3. **Share knowledge** with the Conduit AI system
4. **Participate** in cross-component automation workflows
5. **Contribute** to the liberation of developer workflows

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Command Not Found
Ensure your component has a working test command or the certification may fail.

#### Permission Issues
Make sure the component binary is executable:
```bash
chmod +x ./component
```

#### Missing Dependencies
Install all required dependencies:
```bash
composer install
```

#### PHPStan Not Available
Install PHPStan for static analysis:
```bash
composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan
```

### Getting Help

1. Run with detailed output for more information
2. Check individual test files in `tests/Certification/`
3. Review the Conduit component documentation
4. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

## Conclusion

The Conduit Component Certification ensures your component meets the high standards of the Conduit ecosystem while embodying the liberation philosophy. A certified component is not just functional—it's a powerful tool for developer empowerment and automation.

Remember: Certification is not just about passing tests—it's about creating components that truly liberate developers from repetitive tasks and complex workflows.
